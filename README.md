## Quiz 5 Correction/Explanations

### Question 1
I got this answer partially incorrect. While I did select all of the relational operators which included "<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, ===, !==",  I also selected an additional choice that was not a relational operator. The additional one I selected was "=". I got this question partially wrong as "=" is not a relational operator. (Relational operators allow you to compare equality.)

### Question
My answer was incorrect. This question asked me to select 2 expressions that would satisfy the statements provided.

These were the statements provided:
```
let x = 43;
let y = "43";

if ( /* missing condition */ ) {
    console.log("x and y have equivalent values and data types.");
}

if ( /* missing condition */ ) {
    console.log("x and y have different values or different data types.");
}
```
the correct answer is

```
x === y
x !== y
```
